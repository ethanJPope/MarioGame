I have created a version of mario.

By the way this is my first time making a game so there may be a couple of bugs.

You will need to install java and make sure it is exicutable.

I made a map editor with some simple machanics like moving the screens to what ever position you would like.
When you want to run just click the play button.
For controlling mario use either WASD or arow keys and E for fire and space for jumping.

I hope you like my game and thank you for looking into it.
